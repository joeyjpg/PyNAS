# PyNAS
Very simple nas software written in python.


# What is it?
PyNAS is a piece of software i (and chatgpt) wrote in python, that lets you make a nas by simply running a .py script.
PyNAS uses flask for pretty much everything, from api handling to web page serving.


# How do i use it?
Simple! just download the files, make sure its all in the same directory (you should get a zip from github, just extract that somewhere and leave it be),
and then run the .py file.
Flask will give you 2 ip adresses. 127.0.0.1:8080 is simply the localhost, this cannot be used on other devices.
The second ip is the one you'll wanna connect to.


# Huh? Connect to it? How?
Also simple! just open up your browser (any browser with basic html/js support is supported) and type in the full ip (including the port)
example ip: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080
(NOTE: Yeah, the port will always be 8080. Dont ask.)


# Where do i get it?
If you used your 3 barely surviving braincells you'd know how. If you really dont know, ask chatgpt.


# I have a different question, where do i ask?
For any questions regarding the program, you can reach out to me at joeypersonal0305@gmail.com.
